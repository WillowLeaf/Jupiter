# Jupiter

* Jupiter is an easy-to-use tool for image digital watermarking. 
It will help you have specific watermarker(text or image) embedded into or
extracted from your image file with least damage made to the visual quality.

* It hides information in LSB (least significant bit) of each pixel, which is easy to understand, but also fragile to attack.
Therefore it should not be used in serious situation. Instead, it is just a handy tool for daily use or toy example of this method.

* Command:

image in   -- Embed graphical watermarker into an image file

image out  -- Extract graphical watermarker from embedded image file

text in    -- Embed text information into an image file

text out   -- Extract text hidden within an image file

help       -- Show command instruction

exit       -- Exit Jupiter
